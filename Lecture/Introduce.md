## Functional Programming

### MUTABILITY
> Cannot change 

### Imperative Programming â€“ Object Oriented Programming 
```
var age = 30
age = 40
```

### Mutable State Can happen
- Concurrency
- Race Conditions
- Dead Locks

### Immutable State

### First-Class and Higher-Order Functions
-    Filter Map Reduce
- Pure Functions
    - The function always produces the same output when given the same input
    - The function creates zero side effects outside of it

## RxSwift
> RxSwift, in its essence, implifies developing asynchronous programs by allowing your code to new data and process it in sequential, isolated manner.

### Async 
- Notification center
- Delegate  Pattern
- Grand Central Dispatch
- Closures
